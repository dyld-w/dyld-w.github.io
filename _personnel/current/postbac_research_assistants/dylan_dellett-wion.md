As a Postbac RA, my primary responsibility is to support the lab's work by developing and maintaining [the lab's software tools & libraries]({{ "/repositories" | relative_url }}), primarily [SMILE](https://github.com/compmem/smile). This includes improving the codebase, fixing bugs, and implementing new features to enhance our research experiments. As part of CLAS '22, I graduated from UVA in December '21 with a Major in Cognitive Science with a concentration in Cognitive Psychology and a Minor in Computer Science. After graduation, I worked as a software engineer for a small Charlottesville-based startup for a couple of years before rejoining the CompMem Lab in August '24.
